		<p style="font-size:110%;"> My greatest hobby is watching entertainment media. It doesn’t matter the type, whether its movies, cartoons, comedy, tv shows/series, documentaries or plays. I love and enjoy them all. I use it as a time to relax and unwind. Some people play games, crochet, play sports, read, paint or even cook but watching entertainment media is my special time. When watching media, I get the opportunity to take my mind off the present and just live in the moment. I become familiar with the characters, start making guesses about what going to happen next and I am just relaxed and calm having a grand time for the duration and even after. <br>
My hobby of watching media acts as a medium of escape from my academic life and all of the effects that come from it. Believe me and believe me well. School can be extremely stressful, demanding and sometimes even gruesome. That is not an exaggeration, more of an understatement. It increases my mental and emotional health which is very important when attending university. It gives me a sense of easiness and balance. </p> </br>

		<p style="font-size:110%;"> My personality can be classified as rather mixed. People who are close to me tend to say that I have a rather a playful and cheerful personality. I like having fun and making jokes and just make the best of the moments and great memories. Despite this, I know when it is time to get serious and when this happens, I tend to reserve myself and get really focused. This affects my academic life in a positive light as it gives me a sense of control, so in all the fun and games, relaxation and calm. I get serious when it comes on to <q>buckling down</q>, hitting the books, getting my assignments completed and studying.
I believe my personality and hobby works hand in hand and I know how to have fun and enjoy myself but when it comes to the test I know when to put that focus and my energy on school. Together they work to give me balance with my academic life.

		<a name="Hero">
		<center> <h1 style="font-family:georgia; color:darkred;"> My Hero </h1> </center>
		<video src="../Assets/monkvid.mov" height="38.2%" width="38.2%" controls> </video>

		<p style="font-size:110%;"> My hero is a fictitious character from the Tv Show Monk. His name is Adrian Monk. It may seem ironic for Mr. Monk to be classified as a hero due to his long list of fears and his cowardly nature. But I believe that Mr. Monk is a true hero, despite what others may think I see strength and resilience to see that he has been though, he is continually overcoming his fears day by day. This is because throughout the course of the show Monk continually faces his fears due to his job. Some might ask “Why not just get a new job where you don’t have to be facing so many of your fears and phobias?” That is how I identify his bravery and his commitment. Despite his fears, he pushes through and gets his job done on a daily basis because of his love for helping people and making the world a safer place.<br> 
I chose Mr. Monk to be my hero because I can relate to him. As a female pursuing a degree in Computing, many fears and intimidations come into play. I am pursuing a career in a male dominated field… Am I smart enough? Can I even do it? Then to a broader example: a 20-year-old young woman trying to get her life together in this day, age, country and economy. This brings about many fears and scepticisms. But like my hero Adrian Monk, I am persuaded to face my fears. It’s going to be hard; fears are always going to be there, they’re inevitable. But guess what? I can’t give up. I must push through despite all the odds that are put up against me. There is no point in giving up despite your fears and what has happened in your life. There is no point in <q>throwing in the towel</q>. I must be strong and be encouraged and take it one day at a time, facing all these fears. </p> </br></br></br></br>

		<center> <p style="font-size:110%;"> I believe that the test has a general validity as it asked questions that were directly related to personality and because it was created by a reputable psychologist. I believe that the test was valid in my particular case because I the profile it assigned to me was accurate. People who know me tend to say I am responsible and mature; I believe that fits the characteristics of a guardian.  </p> </center> </br></br></br></br></br></br>
