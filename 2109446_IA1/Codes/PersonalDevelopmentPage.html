		<h3 style="font-family:verdana; color:mediumblue;">  &emsp;&emsp; Chapter 4: <i>Achieve Your Goals</i> </h3> 
		<p style="font-size:110%;"> Chapter 4 spoke about Achieving Your Goals. From this chapter I learnt that must set goals so that we won’t feel unfulfilled or dissatisfied with our current achievements or current situation. When we set goals, we will have something to look forward and also work towards. This in turn will bring feelings of fulfilment and accomplishment. It also spoke about our goals making us better persons. Furthermore, it emphasized how our goals won’t be achieved overnight. We were encouraged to set long range, mid-range and short-range goals. Achieving our goals won’t always come easy, sometimes it takes sacrifice. <br>
This chapter has encouraged me to set goals. Sometimes I tend to compare myself with other my age and question how they have achieved so much more than me. Now I understand that the different might have been that they set their goals and worked towards achieving them. When I set my goals for my life, I will have something to work towards and won’t feel bad when I see other as I will understand they are at a different place in their lives. I can’t just set a big goal and expect to achieve it in a short period of time, I must have short, middle and long-term goals. The short and middle term goals build up to achieving the long term. Nothing in live comes easy, this includes my goals. I must frame my mind from now to understand that much sacrifice is going to be required whether its my time and even money. </p> </br></br>

		<h3 style="font-family:verdana; color:mediumblue;">  &emsp;&emsp; Chapter 5: <i>The Proper Use of Time</i> </h3> 
		<p style="font-size:110%;"> Chapter 5 spoke about the Proper Use of Time. I learnt that if we don’t manage our time well, we will be filled with regret by how much time we have squandered and not achieved what we wanted to achieve. We shouldn’t spend your time on urgent, rather we must spend it on what is important. If we don’t control our time then the time will control us by not letting us fulfil what is important. <br>
This chapter has motivated me to use my time more wisely and meaningfully. I wouldn’t say that I have the best time management, I get things done but I usually wait until the last minute. Now I am encouraged to be more productive. When I do this, I won’t have a need to complain about my achievements. I also learnt that we shouldn’t focus all our time on what is urgent, rather we must balance it with what is important. For example, I want to get a skill of learning to do braids and I don’t manage my time well with all the urgent things like tests and assignments, I will never learn how to braid.</p> </br></br>

		<h3 style="font-family:verdana; color:mediumblue;">  &emsp;&emsp; Chapter 6: <i>Surround Yourself with the Best People</i> </h3> 
		<p style="font-size:110%;"> Chapter 6 spoke about Surrounding ourselves with the Best People. I leant that we should always go where expectations are high. We should surround ourselves with successful people who live up to the values and skills we want to develop, or they are person we want to be like. Always question how the people you surround yourself with affect you; what affect they have on you. If the influence is not good you have to make the decision to let them go. Personal development is important as well because if you become like who you want to associate with there is a more likely chance you will be successful in having them as your company. <br>
From this chapter, I learnt that it is important to surround yourselves with the best people. There is a saying that goes “show me your friends and I’ll tell you who you are.” If one surrounds themselves with time wasters, they can’t expect to productive successful individua ls. So, if I want to be a particular person, I must surround myself with a person who has already chieved that characteristic or goal or like-minded people with the same mindset of what I want to become. What I also got is that I shouldn’t be afraid to let go of some people who don’t live up to the standard that I want for myself. Maybe they’re just at a different season in their life and I can’t let them hold me back and be a hinderance to my growth. Lastly, I leant that I must be willing to develop myself on my own. I can just expect successful people to dwell around me if I am not successful, I must at least work towards being like them and they will see the potential and want to be around me.</p> </br></br>

		<h3 style="font-family:verdana; color:mediumblue;">  &emsp;&emsp; Chapter 7: <i>Be a lifelong Learner</i> </h3> 
		<p style="font-size:110%;"> Chapter 7 highlighted that we must be Lifelong Learners. Formal education is not all. Self-education is very important, so that we can continue to learn and grow. We must decide to learn for the rest of our lives. Reading, learning from observation and reflecting on our own experiences is important. When read books we open ourselves up to new ideas. <br>
From this chapter, I got the understanding that though formal education is important. I must not limit myself to let it alone be my knowledge. I must also strive to be self-educated. It is important as with self-education we continue to learn and improve ourselves in ways that formal education could never teach us. The keys to self-education are reading, learning from what we observe and reflecting on what we have been though. I am an individual who does not like to read books, but I must train myself out of that mindset as through reading books, I acquire new ideas and new perspectives. </p> </br></br>
